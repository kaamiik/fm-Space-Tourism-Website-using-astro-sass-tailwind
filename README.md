### What I learned

I learned to build a multipage website with losts of information on each page. There is a homepage and three other pages that give you some information about space. It was really challeenging to build navigation on the header of the site. There is a hamburger menu on mobile and on desktop There was some challenges to make the style like the design. I tried my best on this.

Also each page has a tab system that you should handle both CSS and JS for this. It was so challenging too.

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba/Kevin Powell Space Tourism Challenge](https://scrimba.com/build-a-space-travel-website-c014) - This helped me for deployment of this website. I really tried to learn from this course and not just copy and paste some code.
